# What is DevOps?
It's an approach, its a set of technical and operational practices that have automation at its center. Similar to agile, It looks to streamline the software development cycle between the development and operations teams through continuous integration.

What that means is businesses can reduce software failures while also providing faster security updates and software patches.
